variables, name given to the memory space.
declaring,creating a variable.
initializing,storing a value/operand in the variable.
statements,written instruction to the computer
code,group of statements.
operators,symbols that assign a value to the variable
datatypes eg sequence(lists,dictionaries/mapping datatypes,tuples)
operands/values,ones assigned to the variable.
loops eg for loops and while loops(instructing the computer to repeat a specific task repeatedly)
functions eg anything that carries parethesis
static function,without parameters
dynamic functions carries parameters(on defining),on calling requires arguments
parameters are placeholders when defining a function
arguments are actual values to the parameters on calling the function
function envoking is as calling a function
defining a function/creating a function
dynamic functions and static functions are defined(created)
> conditions(can be indepedent or nested in the function)
if statements,
a block of code is a group statements that are related and perform a similar task.
eg 
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
anything with a : and indentation is identified as a block of code
lists stores more than one value and uses square brackets[]
lists are muteable,you can add(append),pop,remove an item
dictiories stores a pair of items ie keys and values and uses {}
these are also muteable
sets also store items in the disordered way,and uses parethesis()
items in lists are accessed using indices ie 0,1,2,2....or -1,-2...
tuples are not muteable
type casting refers to converting from one datatype to another
a string is an item put in quotations
