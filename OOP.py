the style writing code statement by statement is called structured programming
solving problems step by step top down is also structured programming 
python is both structured and object oriented programming
OOP(object oriented programming) is a concept of programming that advocates to create 
software basing on real world objects.
eg windows operating system
these systems are named after real world objects like windows for houses for windows 
operating system,apple fruits for macbooks,iphones
all objects come from a class
a class is a blueprint of an object and an object is an instance(copy) of a class
a blueprint is a master copy of an object eg the original thing that we duplicate is class,the 
things we get out is the object
concepts in OOP
>Abstraction
is the level of representation eg.animal,(more details of the animal) 
like domestic animals,wild animals,its what we use to classify objects or identifying a class of an object
through abstraction,we can identify a class of an object,be specific.
>Inheritance
in real world,an can take on different things from different classes.
the ability to behave that way is refered to as the inheritance character eg
class Toyota is a sub class of the main class car
in inheritance we create subclasses from main classes,and wen we delete the main class the
subclasses are deleted too.
>Polymorphisim
here an object can be in two or more classes eg consider a president being at some ocassions,ie
can be addressed as a commander for UPDF,parent at home functions,guest of honor at school ocassions
>Encapsulation
the ability to restrict  access to some class/sub classes  is called encapsulation
>Overloading and Overriding(change the value of something is overriding,like dad=48yrs,me=20ys)
note: classes are written in singular eg class country ie uganda,Burundi
class computer,laptop,animal,phone etc
we identify a class by a phrase 'is a/an'
we deal with a class at a time,not more than one class can be dealt with simulateneously
the name of a class is singular ,we cant have it in the plural form.
a method is a piece of code that defines what an object does tothe other and itself.
and how it does it is called a behaviour
in structured programing the defined function is called a method in OOP
the lines of code within the fuction we wrote in structured programming are called behaviors in OOP.
