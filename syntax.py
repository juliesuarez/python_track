# Syntax for variable names in python
# The name of the variable should not start with a number/numeral(1space,2space)
# The name of the variable should not start with any symbol(#,@,% etc)
# If you have a compound name (name that has more than one name eg pay as you earn) 
# Do not leave spaces with more than one name or compound.( in such a case use under score _,pay_as_you_earn or use camel notation eg pay As You Earn)
# Please use relateable variable names eg if doing calculations use paye,salary,net-salary
# It is recommended to start a varible name with small letters
# While creating variable name it must have a value(salary = 1000)
# Try to use shorter variable names(Sala to mean salary,net to me netpay)
# Do not use key words as a variable.eg False,True,Print
