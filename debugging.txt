A bug is a glitch in software that prevents a program from achieving the desired output.



BUG SEEKING
step1: writing code/coding
step2: trying to break the code(testing)
step3: if you succeed in breaking it,then you need to debug
step4: if you fail to break it,then you are ok,then continue coding

PRINCIPLES OF DEBUGGING
1. Catch your bug as early as possible
bugs caught early are pretty easy to fix because the deals are still in your mind and know where you look.
Catch bugs early
only have one bug at a time
look on what you last changed if your trying to find a bug
always work in small chucks.avoid large chucks
always make small commits
2.if a bug isnt caught it gets harder to find because the details are not in your mind
